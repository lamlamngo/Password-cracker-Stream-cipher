Problem 2                                            50/45 pts

 - Part 1 - Mersenne Twister                                   10/10 pts
   + Correct                                                            8/ 8 pts

   + encrypt                                                            7/ 7 pts

     - More elaborate implementation than I was looking for! +5
     - It's easier to identify longer messages, rather than several
       character words, because more of the symbols that than
       attempted decryption finds won't be valid.
